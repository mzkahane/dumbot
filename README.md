# dumbot
Discord bot using a poorly trained LLM to give nonsense responses. The bot is powered by a pretrained GPT2 model with no fine tuning.
## Usage
Once running, the user will be prompted with `Q: `, after which you can type a prompt and await a response.

To stop the bot a prompt of `STOP` can be used.

## Disclaimer
It is really good at completing sentences, it is really bad at answering questions.
